# belly-botton-challenge
Homework 14 for the belly button challenge of the interactive visualization module of Datavis bootcamp

Title: The Great Belly Button Biodiversity Study

Summary: Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Resources Used: 

Files called "index.html" in the main challenge folder and "samples.json" in the "data" folder, which contain the raw data. 

The D3 library was used to read in "samples.json" from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

Javascript File Used: 

File called app.js in the "statics" folder with full code to fetch the JSON data, to make the dropdown menu and demographic panel, and make the horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart that displays each sample and gauge chart to plot the weekly washing frequency of the individual.

All plots are updated when a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu and app was deployed to Github pages. Both the repo and deployment links were submitted.
